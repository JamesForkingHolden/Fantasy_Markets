# Fantasy_Markets

Weekly stock and crypto market data to support scoring in a Fantasy Markets game

## Game Rules				
				
### Game				
- Each player will own a portfolio of 5-7 stocks and cryptos				
- Every week, players will compete in 1v1 head-to-head matchups				
- Matchups are based on a points system, where each asset independently contributes points based on its weekly ROI				
- The overall winner will be the player with the most weekly wins. Consolation prize will be the player with the most weekly losses				
- Tiebreakers, if necessary, will be based on cumulative points scored				
				
### Team Selection				
- Players will select their teams in a randomized draft				
- Draft is snake style (e.g. First pick in the Round #1 picks last in the Round #2, last pick in Round #1 picks first in Round #2)				
- Each asset may only be drafted once				
- All assets come from Yahoo Finance. Indivdual cryptos or companies must be chosen. ETFs or synthetic assets are permitted as long as they do not track more than one asset
- 30-45 seconds per pick, time for draft depending				
- If an asset is not selected in time, the highest ranked remaining asset will automatically be selected		
- If a player is absent from the draft, the pick will be automatically made as the highest ranking remaining asset				
- Each player will also get to pick a bonus asset, which is not subject to the one asset per team rule above. i.e., everyone can have AAPL in their portfolio as their wild card, and you may also have AAPL twice in your portfolio if you drafted it				

### Scoring System	
- Week-over-week ROI * 100 = points	
- Each asset's ROI contributes equally to a weekly total score	
- The player with the higher score wins for the week
